<h3>How the web works</h3>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em> HTTP Request </em> to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the
  user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.</p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> HTML comprises the majority of the documents on the internet. HTML documents contain <em> text content </em> which describes "what you see" and <em> markup </em> which describes "how it looks" </p>
<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
<li><em>Tags</em>: Used to tell the browser what its supposed to render, can have many different properties </li>
<li><em>Elements</em>: Has an opening tag and closing tag, and contains content such as images, text, audio in between them</li>
<h3>Block vs Inline Elements</h3>
<ul><b>Block</b>: These try o take up all the whitespace from left to right- can have dimension eg. width, height, etc</ul>
  <br>
<ul><b>Inline</b>: These immediately end the line and move on to the next line below, they dont have any extra diminsions, just line breaks </ul>
<h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
<p> Used to define, style, id and title elements, must have quotations around attributes
